Cultureghem is an association that looking for solutions to share the open space under the Anderlecht Slaughterhouse, which is an urban laboratory in which we test, develop and experiment. In this way, we bring solutions to people, that they can reuse where they need it.

From 2013, we start to develop mobile tools, like mobile kitchens, and also playboxes, that you can find here. Playboxes are mobile tools that convert the public space into a playground. Wheeled cube structure used as a toy chest and as a physical element materializing a play area.
